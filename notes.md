# code simplicity

### intro notes: 

- difference bw good and bad programmer is understanding. 
- book will help with: 
	- understanding why software should be developed in a certain way.
	- communicating ideas effectively to other software engineers by helping me understand the fundamental principles on which good s/w engineers base their decisions.

## chapter 1: introduction 

- computers can do a lot of work really fast; creating societal change.
- computers break a lot. reasons:
	- bad programming is one of the only reasons for this (in the context of software)

###### complexity is the major reason. (eg: for context, ms word 2000 ~30 million LOC). the bigger the program gets, the more the complexity increases. 

- programming has to become the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. 
- eg: in the short term programmers want to make something "just work", and this often disregards that they may be writing code that may be incomprehensible to other programmers in the long run/to maintain. this next programmer might add to the complexity by adding his fixes, etc. 
- writing simple to understand programs != absence of lots of code or absence of advanced tecnniques/technologies. 


#### what is a program 
- sequence of instructions given to a computer.
- actions taken by computer as a result of being given instructions.

^ refer to writing and using a program respectively. 

random info: 
- quality of code is the largest problem faced by software projects today. 
- most of this book will focus on improving the structure and quality of the instructions that we give to the computer.
